Utilize this template for multiple scenarios such as new initiative announcements, employee onboarding, modern learning and development or organization-wide broadcasts.  

The app provides an easy interface for designated users to create, preview, collaborate and send messages.

It provides a foundation to build custom targeted communication capabilities such as custom telemetry on how many users acknowledged or interacted with a message.

It contains faq features where users can ask the questions and find answers from the KB. Other existing FAQ+ v3 functionalities like multi-turn, updating from ME etc are also included.
